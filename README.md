simple, experimental java application to extract IFRS tables from PDFs.

The idea was to extract IFRS-relevant content (balance sheet, oci etc.) from those 300-pages annual reports that companies publish.
It provides a web interface to insert a pdf and get and excel sheet back. 
This thing was hacked together over two weekends and is by no means complete and/or optimized.
