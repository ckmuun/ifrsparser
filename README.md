simple, experimental java application to extract IFRS tables from PDFs.

The idea was to extract IFRS-relevant content (balance sheet, oci etc.) from those 300-pages annual reports that companies publish.
It provides a web interface to insert a pdf and get an excel sheet back, or just to crop a pdf and get those 5-10 pages containing IFRS stuff.
Currently only German is supported, and it works okay-ish for a proof of concept, but definitely not perfect.
This thing was hacked together over two weekends and is by no means complete and/or optimized.
